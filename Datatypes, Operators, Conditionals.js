/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/
//string- is a series of characters or are words e.g. 'Flavia' they are usually written in quotes */
let word='string'
let word2= 'is a series of characters'
let space=' '
let combinedWords12= word + space + word2
console.log(combinedWords12)
//Nummbers/Integers - which are wriyyen with or without decimals.
//Booleans- represented by two values True or False
//Objects- used to store collections of data and more complex entities
//Null- for unknown values
//undefined- used for unassigned values/a variable without a value
//symbol- used for unique identifiers 

/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
*/

/* // A variable is a container for storing data values. Declared by var,let or const keyword */

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
 
*/let sum = 12+20
//or
let n= 12 
n+=20
//or
let y= 12
let m= 20
let total = x+y;
console.log(total)

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/let x = 12

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/let name = 'John Doe'

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/let subtraction = 12
let totalSub = 12-x;
console.log(totalSub)

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/
let name1='john'
let name2='John'
if (name1 < John){
    console.log('/nname1 is different from name2')
} else{ console.log('/nboth are equal')}
/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */
let xx= 9
if (xx=1){console.log('/none')
if (xx=5){console.log('/nfive')}
} else {console.log('/nzero')}

/* EXERCISE 9
 [Extra] Assign a value to a variable using a ternary operator (this topic has not been covered during lesson yet,
 try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together!)
